# My Activities in Decentraland

I joined [Decentraland's Virtual Reality](https://decentraland.org/) as an investor and land owner and got using its SDK for the development of a number of projects. Besides the joy of creating virtual structures from code - **Building as Code** - it is Decentraland's community that makes working in this new space so exciting. A vivid exchange with lots of LOL including a direct link with the development team is happening on [Decentraland's Discord](https://dcl.gg/discord).    

## MoVA, the Museum of Virtual Arts, Aetheria Decentraland

The purpose of this project is to build the Museum of Virtual Arts in Aetheria, Decentraland, in which virtual artworks will be exhibited so that they can be experienced by anyone and anybot. The project aims also at establishing a set of ateliers in which Aetherian artists can work and a gallery for the acquisition of virtual artworks.

The museum is Building as Code and includes not only the museum structure but also a set of interactive entities, e.g. elevators. I developed the code in form of an open source library so that everyone interested can customise it to their own projects. The code can be retrieved from the [MoVA repository on GitHub](https://github.com/vrontier/MoVA).

## Programmed Landscapes 

Programmed Landscapes is a libray that helps builders develop larger land plots by positioning entities, e.g. GLTF models in well-defined 2D layers. Once a layer and its grid has been defined, models can be placed by a easy-to-use configuration of relative position on the grid, rotation and scaling. Layers themselves can then be positioned, rotated and scaled. And of course you can combine as many layers with each other as you need. 

The library was [Ile](https://github.com/iillee) - who created the architecture modules as glTF - and my contribution to the June 2019 DCL Hackathon. It is open source and its code can be retrieved from the [DCL Landscapes repository on GitHub](https://github.com/vrontier/dcl-landscapes).

## Building in Decentraland

Today, two ways of building in Decentraland exist: you either can use the official builder which does not require programming skills or you can use the SDK like I do in the projects mentioned above. For the later one, it is of course beneficial if you have a software development background but you can also jump into the tech by learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), the programming language used by the SDK. The official language site offers tutorials and samples and can be used as starting point. Further useful skills include the usage of 3D modeling software being capable of exporting [glTF 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) models, e.g. Blender to name an open source one.   

The best way to learn how-to then use these technologies to create in Decentraland is Carl Fravel's **Building in Decentraland** class of the Decentraland University.
